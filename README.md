# FIFA-World-Cup-2022
This project compares two novel ensemble methods, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, which are used to predict the score of FIFA world cup matches by using the feature-engineered data containing all FIFA international matches covered from 1872 â€“ 2022 and world rankings from 1992-2022. A 2022 world cup simulation is subsequently performed through the optimized best-performing model, namely, gradient boosting. In the paper, the results are also extracted by using three machine learning explainability methods, permutation importance, partial dependency plot, and Shapley value, to better understand the underlying mechanism of the prediction models and the critical factors that contribute to the final result of the game and how each of them leads to the outcome.
